## Understanding Dataset & Data Types
### Dataset Used
Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster

## Objective
To understand the dataset structure, identify data types, analyze missing values, and evaluate the dataset’s readiness for machine learning.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Kaggle Notebook / Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.

- Rows: 891  
- Columns: 12  

## Feature Types

### Numerical
- Age

### Categorical
- Sex
- Name

### Ordinal
- Pclass

### Target Variable
- Survived

## Data Quality Observations
- Missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked
- Class imbalance in survival data

## Machine Learning Readiness
The dataset is suitable for supervised machine learning classification tasks after basic preprocessing.
